# JS-Pokemon-Card-Generator

Program Description

The Pokémon Card Generator is a web application that generates a Pokémon card with randomized stats, type, and an image fetched from the PokéAPI.
The app displays dynamic data, such as the Pokémon's name, stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Speed), and its type, with a unique background color scheme based on the Pokémon type.
